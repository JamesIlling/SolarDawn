# 3. Implement in C# and React

Date: 2024-07-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We wish to keep the number of languages used to a minimum in order to reduce the cognitive load of maintaining the system.

## Decision

Backend code will be written in C#, UI code will be written in React

## Consequences

This uses two languages which are very widely used within industry which are more likely to have useful examples available. C# is ideal for the light data processing we need whilst providing a strongly typed easily readable modern language. React is the leading UI language.
